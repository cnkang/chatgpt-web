# Archived Documents

This directory stores historical, process-oriented, and time-bound documents that are no longer part of the primary documentation flow.

## What Belongs Here

- One-off migration summaries
- Point-in-time status reports
- Historical notes kept for audit/reference only

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep filenames date-prefixed: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Do not link archive files from quick-start paths unless strictly necessary
- Move actionable guidance into `packages/docs/` and keep only historical context here
