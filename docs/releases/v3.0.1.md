# v3.0.1 Release Notes

`2026-02-07`

This release focuses on security hardening and engineering stability. No breaking changes are expected.

## Highlights

- Fixes potential stack-trace exposure in `service` error responses for `/chat-process`.
- Improves CI reliability and dependency maintenance workflows.
- Consolidates linting and security guardrails (`oxlint`, `gitleaks`) for safer default development.

## Security

- `service`: client-facing error responses now return a generic safe message; detailed errors stay server-side and are sanitized before logging.
- `service`: disabled Express `X-Powered-By` response header to reduce framework fingerprint exposure.
- `web`: removed dynamic `appendChild` sink in export flow and switched to direct anchor download trigger.
- Hardened auth flow and sensitive-data sanitization paths.
- Added/strengthened secret leakage guardrails and repository ignore rules for root `.env`.

## CI and Tooling

- Migrated linting configuration to `oxlint` rules.
- Fixed CI lint/build pipeline reliability and workflow permission settings.
- Added Dependabot update policy and auto-merge automation.
- Updated Docker workflow pathing and removed obsolete CI steps.

## Runtime and Refactor

- Migrated service/web HTTP paths to native `fetch` and stream-based handling.
- Removed legacy HTTP dependencies and stale lockfile artifacts.
- Applied code cleanup for imports, unused symbols, and general maintainability.

## Dependency Updates

- `actions/stale`: `5 -> 10`
- `docker/setup-qemu-action`: `2 -> 3`
- `actions/checkout`: `3 -> 6`
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`: `4 -> 6`
- `docker/setup-buildx-action`: `2 -> 3`

## Upgrade Notes

- Pull latest code and run dependency install to align lockfiles.
- If you rely on debug logging for API calls, set `OPENAI_API_DISABLE_DEBUG=false` explicitly.
