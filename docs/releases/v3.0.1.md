# v3.0.1 Release Notes

`2026-02-10`

This release focuses on security hardening and engineering stability. No breaking changes are expected.

Republish notice: `v3.0.1` has been re-tagged to the latest code to include post-release maintenance updates.

## Highlights

- Fixes potential stack-trace exposure in `service` error responses for `/chat-process`.
- Adds strict request-boundary validation for `/chat-process` and `/verify` (type, length, and numeric range checks).
- Adds configurable runtime hardening knobs (`TRUST_PROXY`, JSON body limit, prompt/token size limits, usage-query timeout).
- Improves CI reliability and dependency maintenance workflows.
- Consolidates linting and security guardrails (`oxlint`, `gitleaks`) for safer default development.

## Security

- `service`: client-facing error responses now return a generic safe message; detailed errors stay server-side and are sanitized before logging.
- `service`: disabled Express `X-Powered-By` response header to reduce framework fingerprint exposure.
- `service`: default `trust proxy` behavior is now explicit/configurable to avoid unsafe forwarded-header trust in untrusted topologies.
- `web`: hardened markdown code-block language rendering path to reduce injection risk in rendered HTML.
- `web`: hardened remote prompt import flow with protocol allowlist, timeout, and payload size limits.
- `web`: removed dynamic `appendChild` sink in export flow and switched to direct anchor download trigger.
- Hardened auth flow and sensitive-data sanitization paths.
- Added/strengthened secret leakage guardrails and repository ignore rules for root `.env`.

## CI and Tooling

- Migrated linting configuration to `oxlint` rules.
- Fixed CI lint/build pipeline reliability and workflow permission settings.
- Added Dependabot update policy and auto-merge automation.
- Updated Docker workflow pathing and removed obsolete CI steps.

## Runtime and Refactor

- Migrated service/web HTTP paths to native `fetch` and stream-based handling.
- Removed legacy HTTP dependencies and stale lockfile artifacts.
- Applied code cleanup for imports, unused symbols, and general maintainability.

## Re-release Follow-ups (2026-02-10)

- Standardized local/CI runtime baseline to `Node 24` and `pnpm 10.29.2`.
- Updated CI dependencies, including `actions/setup-node` from v4 to v6.
- Refreshed project documentation and contribution guides.
- Updated deployment templates for Docker Compose and Kubernetes.
- Normalized project licensing metadata and cleaned obsolete documentation assets.

## Dependency Updates

- `actions/stale`: `5 -> 10`
- `docker/setup-qemu-action`: `2 -> 3`
- `actions/checkout`: `3 -> 6`
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`: `4 -> 6`
- `docker/setup-buildx-action`: `2 -> 3`

## Upgrade Notes

- Pull latest code and run dependency install to align lockfiles.
- If you rely on debug logging for API calls, set `OPENAI_API_DISABLE_DEBUG=false` explicitly.
